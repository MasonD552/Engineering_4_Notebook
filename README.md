# Circuit Python

## LED_Blink

### Assignment Description

Getting the board led to blinking on and off every second.

### Wiring

No Wiring

### Code

### Reflection

The LED code wasn't particularly challenging; it mostly involved reviewing concepts from the previous year. The only tricky part was the process of uploading it to the board, which differed slightly as I had to manually drag the code into the "code.py" file instead of simply pressing the F5 key.

## LaunchPad_Part_1

### Assignment Description

Make a count down go from 10 -> 1 and then after one(0) say LIFTOFF. Example: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Liftoff

### Reflection

Learning about the for loop in this was like stumbling upon a hidden treasure chest of possibilities! Honestly, before this, I'd never really needed a for loop, so this was like my first sip of its magic potion.

## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
